Project One Proposal

This project is going to be an app made to propose and either accept or decline "side bets" in my fantasy football league.
The project will be linked to Yahoos Fantasy Sports API and will have our current league information automatically updated. 
Users will login and be able to challenge other account holders to whatever stipulations they like.

Questions we went over we if i'd use cookies or sessions...
	cookies may work alright in the beginning, but as the app gets more complex (if it gets more complex), cookeis may be too cumbersome and sessions would make more sense

Also For the models, it will most likey be embedded relationships
